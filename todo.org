 1. Don't insert data into database if value(s) are -99
 2. Include python code from RPi in the repo
 3. Somehow clarify measurement gaps when generating plots (as weewx does)
 4. put <link> in <head> and add DOCTYPE line to top of page.tmpl 

Regarding #1:
:      set datafile missing "-99"
and make plot using ~1:($2)~ instead of ~1:2~

Or, plot with lines, but when writing scratch file, replace lines with -99 with a single blank line:
